# Jesus Meza — Network Automation Engineer

Im Jesus Meza and im currently a Senior Network Engineer with HCLTech where I am responsible for any network operation issues and netowrk related projects. As of recently I've discovered the world of automation and it has completly changed my view on Network Engineering. I've created several scripts that you can find under my Network-Toolbox folder many of which has helped me and my small team save 10s and 10s of hours of manually work.
