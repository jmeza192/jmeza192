# Jesus Meza — Senior Network Engineer

I design, secure, and automate networks for hospitals and large enterprises. I build in EVE‑NG/Proxmox, automate with Python/Netmiko, and harden environments with Palo Alto NGFW and Cisco/Aruba.

**Highlights**

- **Experience:** 6+ years across hospitals and enterprise networks (Ascension Health IL: 12 hospitals, 3 data centers, 100+ clinics)
- **Certifications:** CCNP, CCNA, JNCIA
- **Focus:** Network automation, security hardening, and scalable operations
- **Lab:** Proxmox + EVE‑NG Pro, PA‑VM, CSR1000v, Windows Server 2022
- **Interests:** QoS, App‑ID/TLS decryption, BGP/OSPF, Wi‑Fi design

**Selected Projects**

- **VLAN Changer + CI/CD:** End‑to‑end VLAN change automation with verification and optional rollback. Finds switchports via IP/MAC lookup, traverses CDP through trunks/port‑channels, applies/validates config, and ships with a GitHub Actions pipeline for audits and reports.
  - Code: https://github.com/jmeza192/Vlan_Changer
  - Tech: Python, Netmiko, GitHub Actions

- **Network Toolbox:** A collection of Python automation tools for Cisco environments: AP discovery via CDP, Serial collection, TACACS audit/update, VLAN changes, and config cleanup with robust `.env`‑based credential handling.
  - Code: https://github.com/jmeza192/network-toolbox-public
  - Tech: Python, Netmiko, Pandas, dotenv

- **Personal Website (This Site):** Tailwind‑based portfolio highlighting experience, skills, and projects, with quick access to my resume and profiles.

**Impact**

- Automated VLAN reassignment workflow reconfigured ~200 devices in under 4 hours (saved ~3 days of manual effort)
- Standardized automation patterns with environment‑isolated configs and multi‑credential fallback for reliability

**Skills Snapshot**

- **Security/Firewalls:** Palo Alto PA‑series (NGFW, App‑ID, TLS decryption)
- **Switching/Routing:** Cisco Catalyst/NX‑OS, Aruba; OSPF, BGP, EIGRP; EVPN, vPC, LACP; QoS, Multicast
- **Automation/Tooling:** Python, Netmiko, GitHub Actions, EVE‑NG, Proxmox
- **Access/Identity:** ISE/TACACS+, ACLs, NAT, VPN
- **Observability:** SolarWinds, Wireshark
